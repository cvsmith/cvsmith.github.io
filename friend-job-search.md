# Thoughts for a friend starting to look for a new job in tech

- **A good LinkedIn profile is essential. I've gotten every job since college
  because of LinkedIn.**

  - It's your combined resume and passive talent agent. Keep it up to date and
    comprehensive. Connect with everyone you know.
  - In my experience, employers pay attention to where you've worked, what roles
    you've had, years of experience, location, school, and mutual connections, in
    roughly that order.
  - Whether or not you set "Open to Work", it tells employers that you exist,
    that you're available, and whether they should reach out to you. Even if they
    emailed you, they found you on LinkedIn.
  - This is advice I got from the CTO at my first internship. It was good advice
    ten years ago and will be for the next ten years. It's here to stay.

- If you're lucky enough to have the possibility of multiple opportunities (you
  are), think about where you would provide the most value. **Who really needs
  you?**

  - This is correlated with higher salary, more satisfaction, more praise, and
    an easier time getting the job. This could mean a particular industry, role,
    company stage , or gap shaped like you in a company.
  - It's kind of (though not exactly) like the baseball stat ["Wins Above
    Replacement" (WAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_above_replacement). How
    much more valuable are you to this company than another randomly selected
    person, given that you both pass the bar for hiring?
    - I think about this in other forms, too, as what makes someone unique:
      - Enjoyment Above Replacement: What do you enjoy more than someone
        randomly selected might?
      - Hosting Above Replacement: How much is a party's theme unique to that
        host, that only they could put it on?

- Balance that with the fact that **until you have one job offer, you have
  none.** Don't get ahead of yourself.

- Success is mostly about the broader market, and a little bit about your
  personal attributes. **Put yourself in the right place at the right time.**

- **Respond to people who are already in your inbox.** It's a great accelerator.
  You have their attention, or at least you've made it through some automated
  filter.

- For startups, **network at VC events.** VCs want to hire for their portfolio
  companies and are motivated to match with the ones where you can add the most
  value.

- For any size company except the smallest, **use LinkedIn job search**. It's
  widely used, has decent filters, and shows you mutual connections for intros.

- Any given opportunity is a sign that you're doing something right, but you
  don't have to take it.
